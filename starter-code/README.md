## User Stories and Feature Tasks

- Continue styling the app using SMACSS practices. Take a few minutes for code review of your partner's CSS and decide how to incorporate it into your paired lab. You can choose one partner's CSS structure, or you can combine them as you see fit. Seek to optimize and organize your CSS as much as possible!

*As a user, I want my app to render articles with consistent formatting so that I can visit the site often and have the same experience each time.*

- Include the Handlebars.js CDN in your project to replace the `$.clone()` template.

*As a developer, I want to utilize the Handlebars library to dynamically render the articles using a template so that I can easily edit the way articles are rendered.*

- Convert your existing HTML template into a Handlebars template.
- Update the `Article.prototype.toHtml()` method to utilize the Handlebars template.

*As a developer, I want to utilize modern JavaScript features so that my code is up to date with industry standards.*

- Refactor the functions and methods in articleView.js to use ES6 arrow functions.

### Stretch Goal
*As a developer, I want to use Handlebars to build my filters so that my code is more DRY.*

- Look at all that duplicated markup inside your `#filter` list items! Looks like a good opportunity to use a template. Make a small template for each filter, and re-render the list once you have data to populate it.
